I want a better way of handling email, with decent filtering (i.e. not
relying on gmail) and a way of accessing it over IMAP without farting
about with ssh.  Useful features:

-- Replies to messages go in same folder as original message, even
   when the message gets moved around. i.e. tag conversations rather
   than messages.

-- Outgoing mail delay.

-- Notifications when an expected reply never appears.

-- Some reasonable text search capability.

Filters which would be worth having:

-- Something to get most [git] and [buildbot] messages out of my
   inbox.  For git, I only really want to see stuff hitting master in
   storagecore, so filter out anything for private branches and most
   other repos.  Maybe have a daily summary of all of the active repos
   and branches.

-- Some way of finding all commit messages related to particular
   trees.

-- Jira handling: track the state of tickets and highlight messages
   related to bugs which have ever been assigned to me.

Plan:

-- Slurp email from all of my accounts using fetchmail.
-- Initially deliver all messages to a pool area, indexed by message ID.
